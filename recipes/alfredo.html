            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>3/4 (16 ounce) package Penne Rigate</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
                <li>1 pound cooked medium shrimp with tails intact</li>
                <li>1 cup chopped green bell pepper</li>
                <li>1 cup diced baby bella mushrooms</li>
                <li>1 (16 ounce) jar Alfredo sauce</li>
                <li>1 (15 ounce) can diced tomatoes</li>
                <li>2 cups shredded Italian cheese blend</li>
                <li>1.5 cups grated Parmesan cheese, divided</li>
                <li>2 (6 ounce) tubs sun-dried tomato pesto</li>
                <li>0.5 cup seasoned bread crumbs</li>
            </ul>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
                <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add penne and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, heat olive oil in a pan over medium-low heat. Add shrimp, green pepper, and mushrooms; saute until vegetables soften, about 10 minutes.</li>
                <li>Drain penne. Mix Alfredo sauce, tomatoes, Italian cheese blend, and 1 cup Parmesan cheese in a large bowl. Add shrimp mixture and mix thoroughly. Add pesto and mix again. Fold in penne.</li>
                <li>Transfer penne mixture to a casserole dish. Mix remaining Parmesan cheese with bread crumbs; sprinkle over the casserole.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until bubbling, 25 to 30 minutes.</li>
            </ol>
